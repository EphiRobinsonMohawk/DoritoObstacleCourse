# Concept:

You are a chip bag trying to be opened to be shared in a bowl. Cut yourself on obstacle pieces
and get a better score for completing the obstacle while getting cut.

# Question

Adventure and puzzle games often donâ€™t have visuals on characters to show that they have
been damaged and damage is usually only reflected within hearts or a UI element on screen.
Could damaging a physical body via spikes to the doritos be better at showing taking damage
then a simple UI element?

# Core Gameplay Loop:

Walk through obstacle, get cut, get more score

# Game Mechanics:

Taking damage on obstacle spikes

# Controls:

WASD - Move character body
Mouse to look around

# Character

Doritios chip bag

# Environment/Setting

A floating obstacle course over a Dorito bowl within a kitchen

# UX/UI

Game over screen at the end to show score and restart.

# Audio: None

Audio would be a nice addition but based on time we are incapable of doing that.

# Game Engine

Unreal
